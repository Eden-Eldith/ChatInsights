# ChatInsights
The Personal Knowledge Graph You Didn’t Know You Already Wrote
ChatInsights is a Python application designed to process your ChatGPT JSON export, analyze conversation concepts, and generate a structured Obsidian vault for knowledge management. It also extracts training data pairs for potential LLM fine-tuning.
> ⚡️ Inspired by this Reddit post: [Mining Your AI Conversation History — r/ChatGPTPro](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1jzzgie/mining_your_ai_conversation_history_the_complete/)

> While I originally built this tool to manage my own GPT conversations, this post aligned so perfectly with the vision that I decided to finalize and share it.

## Features

*   **ChatGPT Export Processing:** Reads `conversations.json` and extracts conversation data.
*   **Text Log Generation:** Creates individual `.txt` files for each conversation, organized by month and year in a `data` subdirectory.
*   **Obsidian Vault Creation:** Automatically generates an Obsidian-ready vault structure:
    *   **Concept Notes:** Creates `.md` files for key concepts identified in conversation titles (using customizable regex). Includes metadata, evolution trends, related concepts, and links to relevant conversations.
    *   **Conversation Logs:** Copies the raw conversation logs into an `Obsidian/Conversations` subdirectory (preserving the monthly structure) and converts them to `.md` files, allowing direct linking from concept notes.
    *   **Maps of Content (MOC):** Generates `Concepts-MOC.md` linking to all identified concept notes.
    *   **Dashboard:** Creates `Concept-Dashboard.md` with Dataview queries for visualizing concept data within Obsidian.
    *   **Term Analysis:** Generates `Recurring-Terms.md` highlighting frequently used terms in titles that might be potential new concepts.
*   **Training Data Extraction:** Generates instruction-response pairs from user-assistant interactions in JSONL or CSV format, suitable for fine-tuning LLMs.
*   **Streamlined Workflow:** The process of getting conversation logs into the Obsidian vault is now fully automated within the app.
*   **GUI:** Provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Use
(I usually just double click it)

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python chat-insights-app.py
    ```
2.  **Select Export File:** In the "Import & Process" tab, click "Browse" to select your `conversations.json` file downloaded from ChatGPT.
3.  **Configure (Optional):**
    *   Adjust the "Output Directory" if you don't want to use the default (`~/ChatInsights`).
    *   Change the "Your Name", "Assistant Name", and "System Name" to match your usage. These names are used when generating text logs and training data.
    *   Go to the "Concept Tracker" tab and customize the "Core Concepts to Track" list. Each line should be `ConceptName: regex_pattern`.
4.  **Process and Analyze:** Click the **"Process & Analyze Concepts"** button. This performs the following steps:
    *   Processes the JSON export.
    *   Creates `.txt` logs in the `data` subdirectory.
    *   Generates `pruned.json` and `training_data.jsonl` in the `data` subdirectory.
    *   Analyzes conversation titles based on the defined concepts.
    *   Generates the Obsidian vault structure (`.md` files for concepts, MOC, dashboard, terms) in the `Obsidian/Concepts` subdirectory.
    *   **Automatically copies** the `.txt` conversation logs from `data` into `Obsidian/Conversations`, renaming them to `.md`.
5.  **Open in Obsidian:**
    *   Once processing is complete, click the "Open Output Folder" button to see all generated files.
    *   Click the "Open Obsidian Vault" button. This opens the `Obsidian/Concepts` folder.
    *   In Obsidian, choose "Open folder as vault" and select the `Obsidian/Concepts` directory generated by the tool (e.g., `~/ChatInsights/Obsidian/Concepts`).
    *   You can now browse the concept notes, MOC, dashboard, and click the links within concept notes (like `[[conversation_filename]]`) to directly open the corresponding conversation log.

### 📚 Universal Concept Tracker Template

This tool lets you track recurring themes or topics across your ChatGPT conversation history. You can define the concepts you care about, and the app will automatically tag and organize them in your Obsidian vault.

#### 🛠 How It Works
Each concept is matched using simple keywords. You don’t need to know regular expressions — just list related terms separated by `|` (the vertical bar), and the tool will match any of them.

#### 📌 Starter Template (Edit This!)

Paste this into the **Concept Tracker** tab to get started:

```
AI: AI | Artificial Intelligence | GPT | Claude | LLM  
Machine Learning: Machine Learning | ML | Training | Fine-Tuning  
Coding: Python | Script | Code | Programming  
Frameworks: Framework | Architecture | Structure | System  
Optimization: Optimization | Optimizer | Performance | Speed  
Server Tools: Server | RCON | Admin | Discord Bot  
Mental Health: Mental Health | Depression | Anxiety | Support  
Neurodiversity: Neurodivergent | ADHD | Autism  
YourProjectName: [ Add your own custom keywords here ]  
```

#### 🧠 Tips
- You can add more concepts by following the same pattern:  
  `ConceptName: keyword1 | keyword2 | keyword3`
- Keywords are **case-insensitive**, so don’t worry about capitalization.
- For personal terms (like codenames or aliases), just add a line like:  
  `ATLAS: ATLAS | A_T_L_A_S`  
- Be as broad or specific as you want — it’s your knowledge map.

```

To take this futher, Use the obsidian plugin [Ai Tagger Universe](https://github.com/niehu2018/obsidian-ai-tagger-universe) and I reccomend [Gemma3 on Ollama 1b version](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3) as the model for super fast tagging
